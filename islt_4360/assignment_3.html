        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>Learning Web Development can set one on the path to share thier ideas with the world. It can give even the quietest voices a platform to be seen on. However Web Development, or any type of programming really, can teach us lessons that help us to be more productive in many other facets of our lives also.
        </p>
            <h3>Programming Teaches Us:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discipline</li>
                    <li>Problem Solving</li>
                    <li>Organization</li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <li>Susinctness</li>
                </ul>
        <p>Programming teaches us to follow rules precisely. You must be disciplined enough to follow the required syntax exactly. It teaches us to go back and look critically at our own work and practice problem solving to discover our mistakes. It teaches us to find meaningful ways to present information in order to get our point across. It also reminds us that there are often simpler ways of getting tasks done. <a href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/">Ken Thompson</a> once said:
