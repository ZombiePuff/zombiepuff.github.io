        <h2><a id="webDev"> Web Development</a></h2>
        <p>Learning Web Development can set one on the path to share thier ideas with the world. It can give even the quietest voices a platform to be seen on. However Web Development, or any type of programming really, can teach us lessons that help us to be more productive in many other facets of our lives also.
        </p>
            <h4>Programming Teaches Us:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discipline</li>
                    <li>Problem Solving</li>
                    <li>Organization</li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <li>Succinctness</li>
                </ul>
        <p>Programming teaches us to follow rules precisely. You must be disciplined enough to follow the required syntax exactly. It teaches us to go back and look critically at our own work and practice problem solving to discover our mistakes. It teaches us to find meaningful ways to present information in order to get our point across. It also reminds us that there are often simpler ways of getting tasks done. <a href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/">Ken Thompson</a> once said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <cite>One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code.</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <h2><a id="chemistry"> Chemistry</a></h2>
        <p>One reason I want to learn to code is to create tools to help students grasp complex ideas. When I was teaching high school Chemistry I wished there were more tools to help students visiualize what was happening at the atomic scale. There is so much untapped potential for helping students learn in this way. Physics doesn't always work the way we're used to when you get down to the quantum scale, and so computer models and applications may help students to better comprehend what is going on better than physical models or drawings.
