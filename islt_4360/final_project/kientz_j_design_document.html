        <h1>Jarod Kientz's Final Project Design Document</h1>
        
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
            <p>This website’s purpose is primarily to function as a study aid for help outside of class for first year high school chemistry students. It will focus on trends of the periodic table, a topic which is often difficult for students to comprehend without having much experience with chemistry. Understanding what different elements would physically “look like” can help one understand an element's electronegativity, its ionization energy, and its electron affinity. Knowing those characteristics can help one understand why different elements interact the way they do. This is one of the most difficult ideas to understand when it comes to chemistry as well as one of the most important. This leads to many students not every really grasping the subject and feeling lost throughout the rest of the studies in chemistry. 
            </p>
        <h2>Target Audience Analysis:</h2>
            <p>The site’s primary target audience is first year high school chemistry students. This means they are mostly 15 and 16 year olds but might be between 14 and 18 years old. It will be an even split between genders, and as chemistry is usually not a required course, visitors to the site likely have at least a little exposure to at least high school level science material. High school students often have lots of activities and classes vying for their time, and typically are not likely to voluntarily read long pages of text. Most current high school students have grown up using the internet at least in a school setting and have a decent grasp on how to navigate a web page. They are however less likely to do so by using a traditional desktop computer and are more likely to try to view the page using a tablet of possible a cell phone.<br> The site also has the secondary audience being high school chemistry teachers. Their profile is much broader. As such so is their experience with the internet and computers. They could very likely be between the ages of 22 and 65 years old. As such it is best to design the website keeping in mind that some users may be unfamiliar with many internet norms and standards.

        <h4>I asked some Chemistry teachers:</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>What is one of the subjects your students have the most difficulty with?</dt>
                <dd>The most common answers were trends in the periodic table, balancing reactions, converting units, and using significant figures.</dd>
            <dt>Which students need the most help?</dt>
                <dd>Their responses focused on students that need things broken down step by step, students who can’t pay attention, and students who don’t care.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>I asked some students that had taken high school chemistry last school year:</h4>
                <dl>
            <dt>What are some of the topics that you needed extra help with in Chemistry?</dt>
                <dd>Common answers were predicting reactions, the math stuff, the periodic table, quantum numbers, and significant figures.</dd>
            <dt>What would make a website explaining topics in chemistry the most helpful?</dt>
                <dd>I received answers like “don’t use big words,” make it simple, use pictures, “don’t make it boring,” </dd>
            <dt>How would you most likely view a website to help you study chemistry?</dt>
                    <dd>All of the students asked said their cellphones, a few mentioned they might use a chromebook.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Reference Websites</h3>
            <p>The following are similar sites with good and bad elements of web design to consider for the final design</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/PT/PTElectronAffin.htm">Kent Chemistry</a>gives us an example of poor navigation, color scheme, and accessibility on any device other than a desktop computer.</li>
            <li><a href="http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Inorganic_Chemistry/Descriptive_Chemistry/Periodic_Trends_of_Elemental_Properties/Periodic_Trends">LibreTexts - Chemistry</a>gives us an example of a well thought out and logical flow of information. It breaks the infromation up into digestible peices.</li>
            <li><a href="https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/">IUPAC</a>has a great color scheme, and layout. It is not particularly well suited for mobile devices, but thier intended audience is likely proffessors, students, and professional scientist often in a lab, classroom or office setting.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/chemistry/fundamentals/atomicstructure/section3.rhtml">SparkNotes</a>provides clear navigation especially with so many pages. It is very well organized.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/periodic-table/periodic-table-trends-bonding/v/atomic-radius-trend">Khan Academy</a> has a simplistic but effective layout that gives the user a clear picture of what they've learned and what they should learn next.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.chem.tamu.edu/class/majors/tutorialnotefiles/trends.htm">Texas A&amp;M University's Chemistry Department</a> has an unprofessional background that makes the website difficult to read.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Content:</h2>
            <p>Based on the responses from the students and teachers I talked with as well as my own experience teaching chemistry, I have decided to focus on explaining quantum numbers and how they relate to the periodic table as well as some of the trends in the periodic table that are caused by an atom’s electron configuration (or its quantum numbers). </p>
        <h3>Organization of Information:</h3><p>By explaining quantum numbers with the periodic table in mind students can get a better grasp of what makes the elements act the way they do, and why the periodic table is organized the way it is. They can then see how the periodic table can help us to understand elements better by seeing the trends that form within the periodic table.  </p>
        <h2>Media:</h2>
        <p>I plan on making all of the graphics and images myself. Mostly the page will have a lot of periodic tables. The information on the periodic table is public domain, however an artists rendering of it is copyrighted as such I will create my own or use one that uses a Creative Commons License and cite the source.</p>
        <h2>Color Scheme:</h2>
        <p>I want to use bright colors as to keep a hold of students attention as well as give it a modern feel.</p>
        <ul><li style="background: #3AFFA8">#3AFFA8</li><li style="background: #E86D0A">#E86D0A</li><li style="background: #FF2C17">#FF2C17</li><li style="background: #1D3A54">#1D3A54</li><li style="background: #EEEEEE">#EEEEEE</li><li style="background: #736917">#0D93FF</li></ul>
